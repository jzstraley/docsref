## Nitrates

- General
    - MOA: Primarily vasodilators that dilate, veins, arterioles, and particularly the coronary arteries by relaxing vascular smooth muscle cells, but also venodilators
        - Their primary anti-ischemic effects are due to ^^systemic vasodilation and decreasing cardiac preload^^ (lowering LVEDV and LVESV) rather than coronary vasodilation
        - This causes reduced LV wall stress reducing myocardial oxygen demand, and relieving anginal symptoms
        - Arterial and arteriolar vasodilation can decrease SVR and blood pressure, but to a lesser degree
        - They do act as coronary vasodilators, but benefit is uncertain
        - - No direct effect on cardiac chronotropy, inotropy (contractility), LVEF
    - USE: Chest pain relief in patients with chronic stable angina and ACS
    - SE: Reflex Tachycardia
        - Concomitant use of beta-blockers to prevent
- **Isosorbide Dinitrate**
    - USE:
        - FDA Approved: Prevention or treatment (glyceryl trinitrate preferred) of angina pectoris from CAD
        - Non-FDA Approved: Achalasia, DES
- **Isosorbide Mononitrate**
    - USE:
        - FDA Approved: Treatment of angina pectoris from CAD
            - [Along with Non-selective BBs, can be used for prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding as secondary prophylaxis if unable to tolerate/refuse EVL][2]
                - 10mg nightly up to 20mg BID
- **Sodium Nitroprusside**
    - Parenteral vasodilator with quick onset and offset of action and is commonly used for rapid BP control in patients with hypertensive emergency
        - Its metabolism releases NO and Cyanide
            - Induces arteriolar and venous vasodilation
        - May cause reflex tachycardia and enhance ventricular contraction increasing aortic wall stress (give BB first)
    - SE: Irreversible Cyanide toxicity (Thiocyanate, most common in renal insufficiency), disorientation, Headache, tinnitus, Tachyphylaxis
    - IV: Use only for patients with ACS or Acute pulmonary edema
    - Avoid in patients with RV infarction and those on PDE-5 inhibitors

## Non-Nitrates

- **[Ranolazine (Ranexa)][1]**
    - MOA: Partially inhibits fatty acid oxidation and increases glucose oxidation
    - Dose: 500-1000mg BID
    - USE:
        - IIa: Chronic Stable Angina Refractory to other anti-anginal therapy
        - Increases exercise tolerance/duration
    - SE: QTc prolongation in liver disease
        - No HR or BP reduction

## Nitrate-Induced Headaches

- Treatment
    - 1st Line: [Cold-Compress][3] and Tylenol
    - 2nd Line: BBs and CCBs
