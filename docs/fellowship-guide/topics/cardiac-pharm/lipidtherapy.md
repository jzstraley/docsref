- [2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol][2]
- Elevated LDL-C
    - Diet: Trans/Saturated Fats, Weight gain, Anorexia, Alcohol
    - Drugs: Diuretics, Cyclosporines, Glucocorticoids, Amiodarone
    - Diseases: Biliary Obstruction, Nephrotic Syndrome
    - Other: Hypothyroidism, Obesity, Pregnancy
    - Dietary fat has a greater impact on serum LDL-C than does dietary cholesterol intake
        - Fats should be limited to ≤30% of total caloric intake
        - Saturated fats should be limited to ≤10% of calories (7% if LDL-C above goal)
- Elevated Triglycerides
    - [2021 ACC Guideline for the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia][3]
    - Diet: Weight gain, Very low fat diets, High intake of refined carbs, Excessive Alcohol intake

- Higher-Risk
    - The following factors that may be considered for the identification of higher-risk patients with clinical CV disease:
            - Age ≥65 years, prior MI or non-hemorrhagic stroke, current daily cigarette smoking, symptomatic PVD with prior MI or stroke, history of non-MI related coronary revascularization, residual coronary artery disease with ≥40% stenosis in ≥2 large vessels, HDL ≤40 mg/dL for men and ≤50 mg/dL for women, hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L, or metabolic syndrome

## Liver
