## Effective Consultation

* Following Dr. Goldman's suggestions, the helpful consultant will:
    * Determine the question that is being asked
    * Establish the urgency of the consultation
    * Gather primary data
    * Communicate as briefly as appropriate
    * Make specific recommendations
    * Provide contingency plans
    * Understand his own role in the process
    * Offer educational information
    * Communicate recommendations directly to the requesting physician
    * Provide appropriate follow-up
