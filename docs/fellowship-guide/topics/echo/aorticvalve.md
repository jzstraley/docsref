* LVOT diameter CSA measurements[^1] [^2]
    * Made at the same level as the velocity recording
    * Used to calculate cross-sectional area (CSA)
        * Using inner edge of the septal endocardium and the anterior mitral leaflet in mid-systole
        * Parallel and adjacent to the aortic valve or at the site of velocity measurement
* AV jet velocity measured by VTI
    * Velocity time integral (VTI) traced from the modal velocity
    * Maximum velocity obtained from the peak of dense velocity curve
* Continuity Equation valve area
    * AVA = ($CSA_{LVOT}$ x $VTI_{LVOT}$)/$VTI_{AV}$
* Velocity Ratio and VTI Ratio, Dimensionless Index (DI)
    * Used to reduce error related to LVOT area measurements (Removes LVOT CSA from Continuity Equation) to check AVA or when there is an prosthetic AV in place
    * Velocity Ratio = $V_{LVOT}$/$V_{AV}$
