## General[^1]

* Most Common sustained Arrhythmia
* 95% of patients are > 60 y/o
* Causes: Atrial enlargement, elevated atrial pressure, atrial infiltration or inflammation
    * Leads to increase in LA load and thus LA pressure thus predisposes to afib
    * Precipitants of atrial dilation and/or conduction remodeling
        * Advanced age
        * Systemic hypertension (MC underlying condition)
        * MV dysfunction (MS/MR)
        * LV failure (CHF)
        * CAD and related factors (T2DM and smoking)
        * Obesity and OSA
        * Chronic hypoxic lung disease (COPD)
        * Alcohol
    * Triggers of increased automaticity
        * [Subclinical or Overt Hyperthyroidism][3]
        * Excessive alcohol use
        * Increased sympathetic tone
            * [Acute illness][4] (sepsis, PE, MI, myocarditis)
            * Cardiac Surgery (Post cardiac surgery due to pericarditis)
        * Sympathomimetic drugs (cocaine, theophylline, amphetamines)

## Definitions

### Paroxysmal AFib (≥2 episodes that terminate spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset)

* 70% at one year to 90% at 4 years of recurrence
* Triggers: Ectopic Foci (Pulmonary Ventricular sites)
* Treatment:
    * Amiodarone, Flecainide, sometimes Ablation (works better): Pulmonary vein potentials in the LA

### Persistent AFib (≥2 episodes, each lasts >7 days)

* Triggers: Electrophysiologic remodeling fibrosis
    * SVC or coronary sinus most commonly
    * Non-Pulmonary Ventricle sites
* Treatment
    * Cardioversion if unstable
    * Medical therapy
    * Ablation usually doesn’t work, try after medicine

### Long-standing Persistent or Permanent AFib (>6-12 months)

* Triggers: Chronic Substrate Fibrosis

### AFib w/ Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR)

* HOCM, HFpEF, Impaired cardiac function
* Symptoms
    * Exercise intolerance, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, light headedness, hemodynamic instability
    * Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy

## Features

* Irregularly irregular rhythm w/ Narrow QRS and variable p waves
    * No distinct P waves, absent A waves, narrow QRS
        * Rate: 100-110 BPM
    * Disorganized atrial impulses all over the atria
        * Usually starts in LA (Pulmonary veins)
        * MC location of ectopic foci (ablate them)
    * Multiple reentrant circuits that coexist
    * P waves occur at a rate between 350-600, ventricular rates slower than atrial rates
    * Rate is determined by AV nodal conduction; arises from uncoordinated or loss of atrial contraction (Chaotic rapid atrial electrical activity)
* Tachycardia may continue despite beats that fail to conduct to the ventricles, indicating that the AV node is not participating in the tachycardia circuit
* Ashman Phenomenon: Aberrantly conducted beats after long-short R-R cycles

## Complications

* Loss of atrial contributions to ventricular filling
* Predisposition to thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage w/potential embolization (Thromboembolic Stroke)
* In patients with MS or HOCM, conversion to sinus rhythm increases embolic risk
* More likely for stoke 5x

## Diagnosis and Work-up

* Diagnosis: EKG to Confirm
    * TTE and TSH/Free T4
        * To assess for atrial thrombi, hyperthyroidism, baseline for long-term
        * Hypertension MCC
    * TEE if TTE shows valvular disease
        * [Echo Features of PAF][5]
    * Exercise stress test after starting medications
    * Holter, telemetry to identify asymptomatic episodes
    * EPS: to test for SVTs (AVNRT/MAT)
* W/U: CMP, TSH, Echo

## Management[^2]

### Rhythm/Rate

* AFFIRM[^3]: Rate-control = Rhythm-control; Rate preferred due to Adverse events
* [Rate vs Rhythm Control in Recurrent Persistent Afib][14]
* [Early Rhythm Control][15]
    * Goal: HR<80 if symptoms, HR <110 if none, EF >40%
        * EAST-AFNET 4*
            * Improved clinical outcomes if early rhythm control in all patients diagnosed within the past 12 months w/coexisting CVD
            * Aggressive rhythm control via Ablation or Amiodarone
* [RACE-II: Lenient non-inferior to strict rate-control in afib][21]
* [RAAFT-2: RFA if AAD failed as 1st line for symptomatic PAF][22]
    * RFA recommended in patients with symptomatic PAF who have failed treatment with at least 1 Class I or Class III AAD

### Acute Afib w/RVR

![ACC 2023 Guideline - Acute Afib](/assets/images/fellowship-guide/cards/electrophysiology/gr17.webp)<br>

#### Unstable Afib w/RVR

* Immediate Cardioversion

#### Stable Afib w/RVR

* 1B: Non-dihydropyridine CCBs or BBs
    * Severe COPD: CCBs (Cardizem)
    * CAD: BBs (Metoprolol Tartrate)

* 2A: [IV Magnesium][18]
* 2A: Digoxin if can't use BBs or CCBs
    * [Total IV loading dose][20]:
        * Normal renal function: 8-12 mcg/kg ideal body weight (usually ~600-1,000 mcg).
        * Renal insufficiency: 6-10 mcg/kg ideal body weight.
        * Typically, 50% of the total loading dose is given initially, followed by 25% given twice, every six hours.
            * The first IV dose (typically ~400-600 mcg) takes effect within roughly 1-4 hours. Monitor for effect. If an adequate heart rate is achieved, then subsequent doses may be omitted. If bradycardia occurs, further administration should be held
* 2B: Amiodarone
* Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)
    * 1 year success rates approach 70-80%
    * Afib recurrence after RFA in 20-40% of patients
        * OSA independently increases the risk of incident atrial fibrillation and increases the risk of recurrent AF after ablation by promoting atrial structural and electrical remodeling including atrial enlargement and low-voltage areas with conduction abnormalities
            * Treatment of OSA with CPAP improves arrhythmia-free survival post-catheter ablation
        * [Repeat ablation][17] is primarily considered for those with symptomatic AF recurrences (often drug-refractory) occurring at least 3 months or more post-ablation
        * At 1-year follow-up more patients randomized to repeat ablation with RF (58%) were AF-free compared with those who underwent cryoablation (43%)[^5]
    * Complications (<5%)
        * Stroke
        * Pulmonary Vein Stenosis
        * Esophageal injury
        * Phrenic Nerve Paralysis
        * Acute Pericarditis (10.2%)
            * [Associated with younger age][16]
