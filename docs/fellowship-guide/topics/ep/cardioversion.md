## External Direct Current Cardioversion

- Indications
    - Persistent Afib
- Considered successful if sinus rhythm of any duration is achieved post cardioversion
    - Unsuccessful in >10%
        - More likely to fail if:
            - BMI ≥30, ≥35, ≥40 are associated with 1.87, 2.50, and 4.9 Relative risk of requiring more than one attempt[^1]
- [Predictors of recurrence after catheter ablation and electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: an umbrella review of meta-analyses][3]
    - Address HTN, OSA, Depression, Metabolic Syndrome
    - AADs may increase the success rate of DC cardioversion
- [Amiodarone pretreatment with intravenous bolus few hours before electrical cardioversion reduces short-term recurrences of atrial fibrillation][4]

## Setup

- Goal: Optimize Transthoracic Impedance
    - Determined by position of the electrodes
        - The lower the better
        - Optimal when atria completely encompassed
    - [RAFF2][1]: No difference between AP vs. AL pad locations in achieving cardioversion success
        - [AP to have better success over AL in patients with lone AF and LA size <45mm][2]

## [Protocol][^1]

- 200J AP Biphasic Shock
- #1 + External Compression (60-100N) at end-expiration
- #2 but anterior pad changed to right parasternal location
- Use 2 defibrillators with crossing pad in AP and right parasternal to deliver 400J shock with external compression at end-expiration
- Position pads under fluoroscopy

## Complications

- Asystole >5s
- Severe Transient Bradycardia w/HR <40 bmp (<1%)
- Sustained ventricular arrhythmia
