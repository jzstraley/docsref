## Pacemakers (PPM)

- Used to maintain heart rate
- [Indications][1]
    - Complete AV block unless 2/2 MI or reversible cause
    - Symptomatic Sinus Bradycardia (HR <40 usually)
    - Symptomatic chronotropic incompetence (Inability to achieve 85% of age-predicted maximum HR)
    - Advanced 2nd Degree AV Block (Block of ≥2 consecutive P waves)
    - Mobitz type II 2nd Degree AV Block (Symptomatic or Asymptomatic)
    - Mobitz type I 2nd Degree AV Block (Symptomatic only)
    - Afib w/bradycardia and pauses >5s
- Consists of a Pulse Generator (battery) and circuitry with 1,2, or 3 leads
    - Single chamber (1 lead) in RA or RV
    - Dual Chamber (2 leads) in RA and RV
    - Biventricular (3 leads) in RA, RV, and Cardiac Vein (to pace LV)
        - AKA cardiac resynchronization devices
- PG is implanted in infraclavicular region
- Malfunction or lead movement: High pacemaker lead thresholds

## Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)

- Primary or Secondary prevention of [SCD from VT/VF][2]
    - [Indicated for prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD)][3]
- Primary Prevention
    - Prior MI and LVEF ≤30%
        - ≥40 days after MI and 3 months post PCI/CABG with an EF ≤30%
    - ICM/NICM w/NYHA Class II or III symptoms and LVEF ≤35% on GDMT
        - Wait for 3 months after initiation of GMDT to assess potential recovery
- Secondary Prevention
    - Prior VF or unstable VT without reversible cause
        - In patients with a FH of cardiac arrest or sustained, spontaneous VT
        - Survivors of cardiac arrest resulting from VF or VT not explained by a reversible cause
        - Syncope and sustained VT/VF on EP Study
        - Brugada syndrome with syncope or ventricular arrhythmia
        - Inherited Long QT syndrome not responding to β-blockers
    - Prior sustained VT with underlying cardiomyopathy
        - Sustained VT in the presence of structural heart disease
- Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy if:
    - Primary Prevention
        - FH of SCD
        - Syncope (recurrent and/or associated with exertion)
        - Non-sustained VT on Holter
        - Hypotensive BP response to exercise
        - Extreme LVH (>3cm max septal wall thickness)
    - Secondary
        - Survivors of cardiac arrest
        - Sustained spontaneous ventricular Arrhythmias

## Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)

- [Cardiac resynchronization therapy and QRS duration: systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression][4]
- Extra wire (3rd wire) in the coronary sinus for synchronizing RV/LV
    - LV pacing in LBBB
    - Improves exercise tolerance, reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease overall mortality
- Indications
    - LVEF ≤35% + Sinus rhythm + One:
        - QRS ≥150ms and NYHA Class III-IV on optimal medical therapy (IA)
        - QRS >120ms but <150ms and NYHA Class III-IV symptoms on optimal medical therapy (optional)
        - NYHA Class I or II symptoms on optimal medical therapy undergoing pacemaker or ICD with anticipated frequent ventricular pacing
        - [Indications of Cardiac Resynchronization in Non-Left Bundle Branch Block: Clinical Review of Available Evidence][5]
    - LVEF ≤30%, QRS ≥150ms with LBBB, and NYHA Class I-II symptoms on optimal medical therapy
- CRT-P: No ICD, aka BiV
- CRT-D: ICD, aka BiV-ICD or Combo device

## Implantable Loop Recorder (ILR)

- Continuous heart rhythm monitoring
- Use: Very rare events (>30 days apart)

## Implantable Cardiovascular Monitor (ICM)

- Intravascular hemodynamic monitoring
    - Pulmonary Artery Pressure Sensors
        - CHAMPION Trial: decrease hospitalizations in NHYA III
