## General

- [Part 3][1]: Adult Basic and Advanced Life Support: 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care
- Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA)
    - Lack of pulse with persistent electrical activity
- Asystole
    - Lack of all electrical activity on the cardiac monitor
    - Determine cause of rhythm (hypoxemia, hyperkalemia, hemorrhage, metabolic acidosis, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or toxins)
    - Reversible causes of Asystole/PEA
        - 5 Hs & 5 Ts:
            - Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, Hydrogen Ions (Acidosis), Hypo/Hyperkalemia, Hypothermia
            - Tension Pneumothorax, Tamponade (Cardiac), Toxins (narcotics, benzos), Thrombosis (Pulmonary or coronary), Trauma
    - Treatment
        - CPR, Epinephrine +/- Vasopressin
        - Fix cause
            - No response to defibrillation
- Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Sudden Cardiac Death
    - Sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation
        - Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) used to signify an event that is reversed
        - Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) used to signify if the event leads to death
    - Etiology
        - HCM (36%)
        - Coronary artery anomalies (17%)
        - Possible HCM (8.2%)
        - Myocarditis (5.9%)
        - Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy (4.3%)
            - [Brugada Syndrome][3]
                - Autosomal Dominant disorder due to Sodium channel gene (SCN5A) mutation found in 25-30%
                - Presentation
                    - Male, attacks occur at rest and during sleep
                        - 3rd/4th decades of life
                        - Polymorphic VT causing syncope
                    - Syncope and sudden cardiac death without structural heart disease
                        - 20% of those without SHD
                - EKG
                    - Type 1 (Typical): â‰¥2mm of coved ST elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3) with associated T-wave inversion and RBBB appearance
                - [Treatment][4]
                    - Asymptomatic: Controversial
                        - Risk Stratification
                    - Symptomatic: ICD
        - Long QT (3.6%)
        - MCC of SDA in the immediate post-infarction period with acute MI
            - Immediate (<10min):
                - Acute ischemia predisposes to Re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias (Ventricular fibrillation)
            - Delayed (10-60min): Abnormal automaticity leads to arrhythmias
    - Most important factor for survival out of the hospital SCA is elapsed time to effective resuscitation
        - Includes adequate bystander CPR, prompt rhythm analysis, and defibrillation
        - Defib possible: Vfib or Pulseless Vtach
        - Defib not possible: Asystole, PEA
            - CPR and Epinephrine

## [Wellens Syndrome (EKG)][2]

- Hallmark: Deeply inverted T waves in V2/V3 (Type B, 75%) or Biphasic T waves with initial positivity and terminal negativity in V2/V3 (Type A, 25%)
    - PLUS:
        - Isoelectric or minimally elevated ST segment, less than 1mm
        - Preserved precordial R-wave progression and no precordial Q waves
        - Recent history of angina
        - EKG without pain
        - Normal or slightly elevated cardiac markers
- Type A often evolve into Type B
- Symptoms
    - Painless mild elevation in troponins
- Complications
    - Highly specific for critical, proximal LAD stenosis
        - Large anterior wall acute MI
            - 75% within weeks
- Treatment
    - Admit to Telemetry is asymptomatic, ICU if symptomatic
    - Cards consult for cath
        - Cath w/Stents (refractory to medical management)
