## Sinus Nodal Arrythmia with Normal Conduction

- General
    - Includes Sinus Tachycardia and Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia
    - Can be Pathologic or Physiologic:
        - SA node dysfunction and AV conduction block MCCs
            - Failure of initiation or conduction
        - Rate of generation of impulses is reduced to <60bpm
        - Common in Athletes, low tone in sleep, increased vagal tone
            - May be due to hypoventilation (hypoxia)
        - BB and CCBS are a common cause
        - Need permanent pacemaker
    - Diagnosis: 12-Lead EKG
    - Treatment
        - Asymptomatic: Leave them alone
        - Symptomatic (hypotension, shock, AMS, ischemia, HF)
            - IV Atropine
            - If Inadequate response
            - IV epinephrine/dopamine or transcutaneous pacing
        - Dual Chamber Pacemaker eventually
            - Sinus Arrhythmia
    - Irregular Arrythmia (Normal Rate, Irregular Rhythm)
    - In response to vagal tone that causes an alteration in the respiratory cycle
    - Changes seen in R-R interval commonly seen in children
        - R-R Increases during inspiration, decreases during expiration

## Sinus Nodal Arrythmia with Abnormal Conduction

- Bundle Branch Block
- Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS)
    - Intrinsic SA node disease, can progress into the SA node itself and into the perinodal area
        - Impaired SA node automaticity because of fibrosis and/or degeneration of the SA node and surrounding myocardium
        - Unresponsive supraventricular (AV and junctional) automaticity foci (no escape mechanism)
        - Excessive parasympathetic activity depresses the pacing of the SA node and depresses the supraventricular foci
    - Symptoms
        - Confusion, dizziness, fatigue, Lightheaded, palpitations, presyncope, syncope
        - Bradycardia
            - MC finding on EKG
            - Associated with Adam-Stokes attacks
            - Can result in bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome (alternating brady and Paroxysmal SVT (often Afib))
        - Sinus pauses/arrests, SA exit block, or alternating bradycardia and atrial tachyarrhythmias
        - Tachycardia-Bradycardia Syndrome
        - EKG: Sinus Bradycardia with delayed/dropped P waves MC
    - Types:
        - 1) Symptomatic Sinus Bradycardia
        - 2) Sinus pause (cessation of SA node impulse generation) and sinus arrest
        - 3) Sinus Node Exit Block (impulse generated normally in sinus node, but fails to conduct within the SA node or perinodal tissue)
        - 4) Tachycardia-Bradycardia Syndrome: Alternating tachy/bradycardia
            - TAs: Afib, Atrial Flutter, Atrial Tachycardia
                - Rapid rhythm suppresses the SA node, the SA node tries to take over after but since there is SSS, there is a long pause after rhythm termination
                - A slow junctional rhythm or sinus bradycardia may take over after the pause
    - Management
        - Assess for meds:
            - Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine)
                - Associated with bradycardia, heart block, and syncope
                - Substitute with memantine
        - 24 hour monitoring if arrhythmia is intermittent
        - Echo indicated if syncope or near syncope
    - Treatment
        - Type 1 or 3: Dual Chamber Pacemaker
        - Type 2: Symptoms + Sinus pauses >3s: Dual Chamber Pacemaker
        - Type 4: Dual Chamber Pacemaker +/- Antiarrhythmic

### Heart Blocks

#### Sinus Block

- Aka Sinus Nodal Block
- No P waves
    - Doesn’t change subsequent timing, but may see escape beat
- SSS is a type

#### AV blocks

- Normal: PR is 120-200ms
    - PR >200ms indicate AV block
- AV conduction system comprises:
    - AV node, the bundle of His and its left and right bundle branches
    - 3 degrees of AV blocks depending on the extent of impaired conduction
    - Causes
        - Lyme, Chagas, Syphilis
        - SLE Mom w/kid
- Congenital AV block w/ normal heart
    - Acute MI – transient 1 or 2 av block
- Inferior > anterior acute MI is going to cause a 2nd degree or higher
- Diagnosis: Determine the level
    - Vagal maneuvers, carotid sinus massage
        - Slow AV conduction, less effect on infra-nodal tissue
    - Exercise, atropine, isoproterenol
    - Improve AV conduction, impair infra-nodal conduction
    - 1) Normal QRS (<120msec)
            - Likely due to delayed AV node conduction
    - 2) Prolonged QRS (>120msec)
            - Delay below AV node, may progress to 2nd degree
- Medications that can cause AV Blocks (ABCD) – SA/AV nodal blockers
    - Adenosine
        - Aborts SVT, stress tests
    - Beta Blockers
        - Beta-1 specific (metoprolol) have greater HR affects
        - Bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, AMS, normal vision
    - CCBs (Diltiazem and Verapamil)
        - Affects BP but not HR
    - Digoxin
        - Used in Atrial Fibrillation in HFrEF
        - Bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, AMS, Altered Vision

##### 1st Degree AV Block

- Usually, benign prolongation of AV node conduction
    - Fixed, regular rhythm with P-R interval prolonged (>200ms)
    - 1:1 conduction of the AV node is well preserved
        - 1 P wave corresponding to 1 QRS
- Causes are usually reversible:
    - BBs and CCBs (depress AV node conduction)
    - Vagal maneuvers that increase tone (sleep)
    - Transient ischemia (RCA angioplasty complication)
    - Metabolic (Hyperkalemia)
- Non-reversible
    - AV node sclero-degenerative diseases, MI, trauma during surgery or ablations
- Treatment:
    - Usually asymptomatic: No treatment

##### 2nd Degree AV Block

- Intermittent conduction
- Mobitz Type I (Wenckebach)
    - Block involving the AV node
        - Usually, benign AV node conduction dysfunction
    - Characterized by a gradual progression of the PR interval with each beat until a QRS does not follow a P wave for a single beat (P wave without a QRS)
        - The PR interval following the non-conducted wave is usually short
        - RR interval is irregular
        - Usually doesn’t involve the bundle of His
    - Causes: Athletes with high vagal tone, OSA (high vagal tone)
        - RCA MI may have, usually reversible
        - Fatigue/Dizziness occasionally
    - Treatment
        - Symptomatic: Pacemaker
        - Asymptomatic: Observe
- Mobitz Type II (Mobitz)
    - Block of the Purkinje fiber bundles (His or Bundle Branches)
    - Sudden loss of the QRS complex following a p wave without progressive P-R lengthening on prior beats (PR interval is fixed)
        - Most waves conduct 1:1 with similar PR intervals, and the non-P wave suddenly does not conduct to a QRS
        - Sometimes 2 sequential P waves are followed by a QRS in the case of a 2:1 Mobitz Type II AV block, and 3 sequential P waves follow a 3:1 block
    - Irreversible usually:
        - Hyperkalemia, aging due to sclero-degeneration of the AV node, MI, cardiac surgery or ablation mistakes
    - May progress to 3rd Degree heart block, Bundle branch block
    - Treatment
        - Asymptomatic or Symptomatic: Pacemaker

##### 3rd Degree AV Block (Complete Heart Block)

- Lack of conduction across the AV node (Block between SA and AV node)
    - Complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular contractions
- Usually, an intrinsic AV node dysfunction
    - May occur due to extensive ischemic myocardial injury (anterior or inferior MI), sclero-degeneration of the AV node, during catheter ablation and cardiac surgery of the valves
        - Trifasicular or bifasciular can progress to complete heart block
- Syncope, SCD
    - Inferior MI block is usually transient
        - IV atropine if needed
    - Anterior MI blocks are usually permanent
        - 2nd/3rd degree blocks likely need temp pacer -> permanent
    - Infiltrative diseases of the heart such as sarcoid
    - Congenital block may be asymptomatic until adolescence, still need pacemaker
    - Reversible causes: hyperkalemia (hemodialysis patients or patients on ACEI), BB, CCBs, or digoxin
- Atrial impulses fail to capture ventricles
    - Escape rhythm is usually present
        - Narrow (Junctional Escape) or Wide (Ventricular Escape)
- Ventricular asystole (syncope/death) unless an escape rhythm is initiated:
    - P waves do not relate to QRS (AV dissociation)
    - Regular RR and PP intervals, Atrial Rate > Ventricular Rate (<50)
    - P waves appear with a different rate than the ventricular escape rhythm
- Symptoms
    - Lightheadedness, fatigue, SOB, or presyncope and syncope
    - Adams-Stokes (or Stokes-Adams) attacks are attacks of syncope in the setting of a 3rd Degree AV Block/SVT/Afib
        - Brain blood supply insufficiency may cause LOC
- Treatment
    - Intermittent w/Bifasicular or Trifasicular block
        - Permanent pacemaker
    - Asymptomatic or Symptomatic:
        - Temporary pacemaker
        - Permanent if no reversible cause found
