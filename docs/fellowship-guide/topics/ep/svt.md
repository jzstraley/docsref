        - Non-Re-Entrant Junctional Tachycardia
            - Ectopic Junctional Tachycardia (JET)
            - Non-Paroxysmal JT (PJRT)
        - Re-Entrant Junctional Tachycardias
            - AVNRT (Typical of Atypical)
            - AVRT (Accessory Pathway)

- [2015 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline for the Management of Adult Patients With SVT][1]
- [Evaluation and initial treatment of supraventricular tachycardia][2]
- Main Point: SVTs originate at or above His-Bundle (excludes AF)
    - Originate from or are dependent on conduction through the atrium or AV node to the ventricles
    - Any arrythmia initiating in the atria and involving the AV node or an accessory pathway
        - Most common type of SVT is due to AV node reentry (AVNRT)
- Usually there are no regular p waves (buried within the QRS), but retrograde P waves can occur
    - May be seen in the beginning or the end of a QRS complex when the atria and ventricles are not simultaneous
    - Can appear as spikes on QRS complexes or as inverted P waves
- Mostly narrow complex tachycardia (QRS <120ms), rate ~160 bpm
    - Narrow QRS unless AV nodal dysfunction or pre-excitation
- Symptoms
    - Sudden onset palpations and dizziness in a young patient, near syncope, lightheadedness, diaphoresis and chest pain
    - Symptoms of palpitations: 12 lead ECG

## Sinus Nodal Atrial Tachycardias (ST/IST)

### Sinus Tachycardia (ST)

- Rate >100 BPM, Regular, rarely exceeds 220
- P waves before each QRS, PR interval ≥120ms
- Upright P waves in Lead I, II, aVF, V3-V6
- Ventricular rate ≥100 bpm
        - More common than Inappropriate ST
        - Gradual onset and termination
- Slowed by vagal maneuvers, sinus massage
        - Usually doesn’t exceed maximum for age
- (.85) x (220 - patient age) = maximum predicted
        - Physiologic: Precipitated by exertion, stress, illness (panic attacks), dehydration
- Sympathetic stimulation and vagal withdrawal
        - Pathologic process: Pulmonary Embolism

### Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST)

- Rate: 100-180 BPM
    - Normal P waves, may be an ectopic atrial tachycardia w/focus near the SA node
- Dysfunctional Autonomic Regulation
    - Tachycardia may continue despite beats that fail to conduct to the ventricles, indicating that the AV node is not participating in the tachycardia circuit
- Symptoms
    - Fatigue, dizziness +/- syncope in 30-40 y/o women
- Carotid Massage: Atrial Rate may slow
- Treatment if no underlying cause:
    - 1) Ivabradine 5mg PO BID (inhibits funny channel responsible for normal Sinus node automaticity, only lowers HR)
    - 2) BB, CCBs, Digoxin, or catheter ablation

### Sinus Nodal Re-Entry Tachycardia

- Occurs within the sinus node cluster of cells and is conducted throughout the heart in a normal fashion
    - Long RP interval, p waves are identical in axis and morphology as sinus Ps
- Vagal maneuvers and adenosine will terminate
- Abrupt onset and termination
- Treatment
    - BB, CCBs, Digoxin

## Atrial Tachycardias (EAT/MAT)

- Most commonly due to enhanced or abnormal atrial automaticity or triggered activity
- AV Block: More A’s than V’s

### Ectopic (Focal) Atrial Tachycardia (EAT)

- Rate: 150-250 BPM (slower than Atrial Flutter)
- Confined completely to atrial tissue
- Regular Atrial Tachycardia with defined p wave (Differs from normal P wave)
    - Usually paroxysmal and resolves spontaneously
    - Frequent Origins: along valve annuli of LA or RA, pulmonary veins, coronary sinus musculature, SVC
    - Abnormal Automaticity, triggered automaticity, a small reentry circuit confined to the atrium or atrial tissue extending into a pulmonary vein, pulmonary sinus, or vena cava
    - The closer the ectopic focus is to the SA node, the closer the p-wave resemblance to Sinus Tachycardia, and the narrower the PR interval
    - Atrial rate typically increases over initial 10s, then stabilizes to 150-250
- Tachycardia may continue despite beats that fail to conduct to the ventricles, indicating that the AV node is not participating in the tachycardia circuit
    - 1:1 AV Response
        - AVN Blockade increases AV block with continuation of Atrial Tachycardia, atrial rate unaffected (No termination)
    - May terminate tachycardia w/preceding warm up or cold down phase
        - Gradual initiation and gradual termination possible (long RP)
- Often seen in CAD, COPD, Alcohol use
- Can be Sustained, Non-sustained, Paroxysmal, Incessant
    - Sustained and Non-sustained EAT are often a precursor to AF and Aflutter
    - Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia w/AV block: Digitalis Toxicity
        - Can increase ectopy in atria or ventricles
    - Incessant EAT: can cause Tachycardia Induced Cardiomyopathy
    - Paroxysmal EAT: may become incessant
- Carotid Massage: AV block may increase, doesn’t usually revert, may uncover an ectopic atrial tachycardia
- Treatment
    - Goal: Slow ventricular rate
    - Stable: BB, Diltiazem/Verapamil to decrease HR
        - Refractory/Definitive: Catheter Ablation
    - Unstable: Synchronized Cardioversion

### Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)

- ≥3 different P-wave morphologies prior to QRSs, Irregularly irregular rhythm
    - HR typically between 100-150
    - Multiple atrial foci (multiple discrete p waves) with increased automaticity irritated by increased atrial pressures or hypoxia
        - AECOPD, Hypokalemia, Catecholamine Surge (Sepsis), PE, Pneumonia, hypomagnesemia
    - Clear isoelectric intervals between p waves, and the atrial rate is slower
        - Usually caused by severe pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute illness, pulmonary hypertension, coronary disease, valvular disease, hypomagnesemia, theophylline
- Tachycardia may continue despite beats that fail to conduct to the ventricles, indicating that the AV node is not participating in the tachycardia circuit
- Symptoms
    - Typically asymptomatic
- Treatment
    - Treat Underlying Condition (generally slower)
        - CCBs/Metoprolol long-term
    - Acute Exacerbation: IV Metoprolol/Verapamil (CCBs)
        - Amiodarone/Ablation/Cardioversion do work in MAT

## Junctional (AV) Arrhythmias w/o Re-entry (JET/AJR)

- A rapid, narrow complex arrhythmia arising from the AV junction, including the Bundle of His
- VA Block: More V’s than A’s
- General Treatment
    - Acute: IV BB for symptoms, IV diltiazem, procainamide or verapamil
    - Chronic:
        - 1) Oral BB, CCBs
        - 2) Catheter ablation

### Accelerated Junctional Rhythm (AJR)

- Occurs when AV node automaticity rate is faster than SA node or Atrial Foci
- Narrow QRS (HR 60-100), retrograde P waves may be visible
    - Between 60-100 BPM w/gradual increase in rate (Automatic Focus) or after a PVC (focus of triggered automaticity)
    - AV dissociation present
- Often caused by digoxin toxicity (assess for upsloping ST throughout and digoxin levels), may be MI also, severe ischemic heart disease, coronary reperfusion

### Ectopic Junctional Tachycardia (JET)

- Due to automaticity within the AV node near the His-Bundle
    - Incessant tachycardia in children during perioperative congenital heart surgery, or after cardiac surgery in pts with CHF, Rare in adults
- Regular atrial rate, Narrow QRS (120-220) often w/VA block
    - Regular rhythm, occasionally irregular
    - AV dissociation (due to focus within AV node)
        - Can be seen with Adenosine, but rhythm not terminated
- Can be seen after isoproterenol use
- Treatment
    - Need rate control if symptomatic
    - Risk complete AV block due to proximity to AV node if ablation

## Junctional (AV) Arrhythmias with Re-entry (AVNRT/AVRT)

### Atrioventricular Nodal Re-entrant Tachycardia (AVNRT)

- Most common and regular SVT in adults, more common in women
    - Re-entry is the MCC of narrow QRS complex tachycardia
    - Slow/Fast pathway + PAC
    - MC PSVT (60%), most common paroxysmal sustained tachycardia in young healthy adults, normally structured hearts
- Paroxysmal, regular, narrow QRS tachycardia with p waves that may or may not be visible
    - HR from 150-250 bpm w/ regular ventricular response of 180-200
    - P waves are rarely seen, may be seeing in the terminal aspect if QRS in V1
    - RP interval is short, p wave may not be apparent
- Uses AV node nodal and perinodal tissue (does not involve atria and ventricles)
- Conduction from Atrium into the AV Node that is bidirectional
    - Due to the presence of 2 conduction pathways (slow and fast) in the AV node and involving the atrium
    - Normally sinus beats pass through the fast pathway and the slow pathway conduction is extinguished due to the refractory period
        - The slow pathway conducts both anterograde to the ventricle and retrograde toward the tricuspid valve (thus simultaneous conduction of atrium and ventricle)
        - The fast pathway does not
    - AVNRTs utilize Slow conducting pathway
        - The slow pathway has transitional cells and fibers
        - Usually inferior extension from AV node near His bundle along Tricuspid valve annulus to the coronary sinus floor
        - If a PAC occurs during the refractory period of the fast pathway, it can initiate AVNRT that is then sustained by a reentry mechanism
        - The 2 pathways then form a looped circuit with impulses traveling antegrade through the slow pathway and return through the fast pathway
            - Atria and Ventricles are not a part of circuit
- Palpitations > dizziness, dyspnea, chest pain, or SOB
    - 1:1 AV response, AVN Blockade terminates Tachycardia
        - Dual electrical pathways within or near the AV node
- Vagal Maneuvers (Carotid sinus massage, cold-water immersion or diving reflex, Valsalva, eyeball pressure) increase parasympathetic tone in the heart and slow AV nodal conduction and increase the refractory period (terminating AVNRT)
- Treatment
    - Acute Stable: Vagal, Valsalva
        - Adenosine 15mg IVx1, 12mg IV q1-2min x1-2 as needed
            - Useful if narrow or wide and regular
        - CCBs, BB
    - Chronic: Same as above or flecainide > Ablation of slow pathway
    - Acute Unstable: Adenosine/Vagal > Synchronized Cardioversion
        - +/- BB or CCB > Flecainide or propafenone if no SHD
        - Amiodarone if SHD
    - RF catheter ablation is curative in 95%
        - First line to prevent recurrences
        - Small risk of complete AV block

### Atrioventricular Reciprocating Tachycardia (AVRT)

- General
    - Accessory Pathway Rhythms
        - Myocytes spanning between the upper and lower chambers across the AV groove (distinct accessory pathway)
        - Atria and Ventricles are involved in this pathway, Normal AV node (unlike AVNRT)
    - Sudden onset, spontaneous termination
    - Ventricular Preexcitation
        - Characterized by the Delta Wave
            - Indicates anterograde accessory pathway or bypass tract
            - Conducts impulse from atria to ventricles w/PR <120msec
        - Seen in Ebstein Anomaly
        - Associated with increased risk of sudden death, likely 2ndary to an accessory pathway conducting to the ventricle
            - Can degenerate into VT or VF
            - Lower risk if intermittent loss of preexcitation
    - MC in children, 30% of all SVTs
    - Caused by a bypass tract from the atrium to the ventricle that extends beyond the tricuspid and mitral valves, which typically block any AV conduction
        - Bypass tract may be anterograde, retrograde, or capable or both
        - Pre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node through this bypass tract
    - The accessory pathway may be concealed or manifest
        - A pathway may not be obvious on ECG and only conduct retrograde during an SVT (Concealed)
        - WPW or Ventricular preexcitation are manifest due to the presence of a delta wave
    - HR 150-250 with regular ventricular response
    - Respond to vagal maneuvers, adenosine, verapamil

#### Orthodromic AVRT (Retrograde P wave)

- 90-95% of all Accessory Pathway SVTs
- Conduction through the AV node, Retrograde conduction back up through the bypass tract
    - Uses atrial and ventricular tissue, accessory pathway, AV Node, and His-Purkinje (excitation through the AV node and accessory pathway are required)
    - Re-entry through accessory bundle
- Paroxysmal sustained tachycardia similar to AVNRT
    - Narrow QRS complexes during tachycardia
    - 1:1 AV Response, AVN Blockade terminates Tachycardia
- Treatment
    - Vagal maneuvers
        - Adenosine 15mg IVx1, 12mg IV q1-2min x1-2 as needed
    - Acute Unstable: Adenosine/Vagal > Synchronized Cardioversion
        - No Pre-Excitation: CCBs or BBs
        - Catheter Ablation for all AVRT
        - No SHD: Propafenone, flecainide
        - SHD: Amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide
    - Chronic: Oral BB, CCBs if no pre-excitation

#### Delta Wave Present

- Delta wave only seen in Anterograde paths (initial slope of QRS)
    - Depolarization of the ventricular tissue from conduction of the atrium to the ventricle along the bypass tract
    - No delta waves if no anterograde conduction

##### Wolff Parkinson White Disease (WPW)

- Accessory pathway conducts depolarization directly from atria to ventricle without traversing AV node
    - Characterized by atrial tachyarrhythmia occurring in the presence of an anterograde conducting accessory bypass tract allowing pre-excitation
- Features
    - Short PR, Delta Wave, Widened QRS complexes
    - Ventricular Pre-excitation during Sinus Rhythm Present
        - A-fib in 10-30%, Persistent a-fib can lead to rapid ventricular response (RVR) and eventually VFib
            - Increased risk for A fib and AVRT
            - Can degenerate into VF and cause SCD
- WPW Syndrome
    - Called WPW Syndrome when symptomatic
        - Pre-existing WPW pattern who develop symptomatic supraventricular arrhythmias involving the accessory pathway
        - No longer pre-exciting the ventricles but instead form a reentrant circuit back to the atria
            - Initial widening of QRS converts to a narrow QRS with tachycardia when symptomatic
                - AVRT is MC, found in up to 80% of syndrome patients
                - 95% of re-entrant tachycardias
                - Afib in 15-30%
                    - Potentially life-threatening
                    - May degenerate into VF if short anterograde refractory period
    - Symptoms
        - Palpitations
        - Lightheadedness
        - Presyncope or syncope
        - Chest pain
    - Complications
        - SCD (1%)
    - [WPW and Preexcitation Syndromes][3]
- W/U:
    - Asymptomatic
        - High Risk for Arrhythmias (Hx of AF or AVRT, Short Refractory Period (<250ms) of the accessory pathway
        - [Noninvasive testing (Exercise Treadmill Test or Procainamide Challenge) and/or EPS to identify risk of SCD][4]
            - EPS in high-risk occupations (Truck drivers, pilots, athletes)
            - Intermittent loss of preexcitation w/faster HR (loss of Delta) with the above
                - Suggests longer refractory period that will not be able to conduct often enough during AF to degenerate into VF
                - Low Risk
                - No further Evaluation or treatment
- Treatment
    - Avoid Amiodarone/AV nodal blocking agents if possible
    - BB and Verapamil are CI = cardiac arrest by decreasing the degree of concealed retrograde conduction
    - Stable: No therapy
    - Stable with Atrial Fibrillation: Procainamide or Ibutilide
        - Do not cause AV block because AV-node blockers promote more conduction through accessory pathway
            - Rapid ventricular response
    - Unstable or with Atrial Fibrillation
        - Electrical Synchronized Cardioversion

##### Delta wave without Tachycardia (Not WPW)

- High risk for SVTs, short PR, prolonged QRS > 110

#### Pre-Excitation AVRTs

- Secondary to pre-excitation along AV accessory pathway
- Seen in Ebstein anomaly (up to 20%)
- Wide QRS tachycardia with QRS Similar to VT
    - Ventricular Pre-excitation during Sinus Rhythm:
        - Absent (Concealed Accessory pathway)
    - SVT w/Aberrancy (preexisting or functional BBB)

##### Antidromic AVRT (Wide QRS)

- Anterograde conduction down the bypass tract, retrograde conduction back up through the AV node/His-Purkinje System
- Wide QRS complex tachycardia with regular rhythm
    - Regular paroxysmal tachycardia
        - Occurs in 10% of patients with WPW syndrome with Tachycardia (Least common arrhythmia associated with WPW)
        - Most Common Pre-Excitation Tachycardia
- Preexcitation in sinus rhythm

##### Atrial Fibrillation w/ Preexcitation

- Irregular wide complex, or intermittently wide complex tachycardia, some >250/min
    - Increased risk of SCD
        - Treatment
            - Procainamide of cardioversion
            - No AV blocking agents

##### Atrial Tachycardia or Flutter w/ Preexcitation

- Treatment
    - Ablation is usually curative

##### Pre-Excitation AVRTs Treatment

- Treatment for all:
    - No Adenosine (Vfib)
    - No CCBS, BBs (hypotension)
    - Offer catheter ablation
    - Unstable + Wide QRS: Electrical Cardioversion
