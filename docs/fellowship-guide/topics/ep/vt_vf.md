## [Nonsustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT)][1]

- ≥3-5 consecutive ventricular beats lasting <30s
    - Patient remains hemodynamically stable
    - 0-4% of ambulatory patients
    - Frequently asymptomatic
    - W/U: EKG +/- CXR/TTE
    - Treatment
        - Admit if
            - High-Risk (Age >45, Symptomatic, Known SHD, Concerning FH)

## General

- Patients with CHD and LV systolic dysfunction are at increased risk of ventricular arrythmias including VT and VF
    - 95% of wide complex tachycardias are VT in pts with SHD
    - Associated with
        - Dilated Cardiomyopathies, Brugada’s syndrome, HCM, Amyloidosis/Sarcoidosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, TOF, and myocarditis
- Treatment in patients with Recurrent VT
    - 1) Stabilize
    - 2) Find underlying cause (electrolyte abnormalities)
        - Order Electrolyte panel and Digoxin level
        - Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia (loop diuretics)
        - Digoxin +/- Hypokalemia


## Types

1) Fast Ventricular Tachycardias
    - Monomorphic VT (MVT)
    - Sustained Monomorphic VT (SMVT)
    - Polymorphic VT (PVT)
2) Slow Ventricular Tachycardias
3) Ventricular Fibrillation

### Fast Ventricular Tachycardias

- >3 consecutive premature ventricular beats (widened QRS)
    - Wide QRS complex tachycardia often w/ abnormal QRS complexes and T waves in the vector opposite of the QRS
    - Common, along with Vfib, post MI
    - Pulse or pulseless presentation

#### Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (MVT)

- Etiology
    - Rapid and repetitive firing of ≥3 premature ventricular complexes in a row with the same morphology
    - Macro re-entrant circuit with conduction through and around scar tissue, reentry of an ectopic ventricular depolarization
    - May be post MI (reentry)
- QRS wide (>0.12), uniform and stable, rate between 100-250
- AV dissociation may be apparent (regular rate between p waves)
    - Cannon A waves in the neck
    - Capture beats and fusion beats possible
- Symptoms
    - Palpitations, dyspnea, lightheadedness, angina, or near-syncope, syncope, seizures
- Treatment
    - Stable/Pulse: IV amiodarone, metoprolol, revascularization OR Synchronized cardioversion
    - Pulseless: CPR + Defibrillation +/- Vasopressors

#### Sustained Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (SMVT)

- Wide complex tachycardia with 2 fusion beats
- Fusion beats: capture of electrical signal though both the atrium and ventricle briefly
    - Hybrid of a normal and wide QRS complex (P waves precede fusion complex)
- Treatment
    - Stable: IV Amiodarone > Procainamide, sotalol, lidocaine
    - Unstable: Synchronized Cardioversion

#### Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (PVT)

- Triggered tachycardia, >220 can cause Ventricular Fibrillation
- Wide complex, rapid and unstable
- QRSs vary in amplitude, size, and duration
    - Normal QTc = Coronary Ischemia (MI)
    - Prolonged QTc = Torsade De Pointes
        - Men >440ms, women >460ms
- A) Torsade De Points (Polymorphic VT, TdP)
    - A rapid PVT with PVCs before T wave, may cause syncope
    - VT with constantly changing cycle length, axis, and morphology
        - Onset: prolongation/lengthening of the QT interval which can be initiated by a PAC/PVC
    - Causes: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, genetic Long QT
        - Medications increasing QT interval via inhibition of the rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (Ikr)
        - Meds: Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin
        - RF for drug induced: QTc >500ms, QTc lengthening >60ms, female, age >65, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, HFrEF, ≥2 QT prolonging drugs, rapid IV admin
        - 30% have mutation in one of 5 QT syndrome genes
    - Goals
        - K >4, Mg >2, EKG q3-6m
        - Baseline then annually if on methadone, daily if >120mg
    - Treatment
        - Stable
            - IV Magnesium sulfate, avoid QT prolongation, lidocaine, increase HR (shortens QT)
                - Even if normal serum Mg
            - Temporary pacemaker, isoproterenol
        - Unstable: Defibrillation

#### General Management

- Pulse + Stable and Sustained Monomorphic
    - IV Amiodarone > lidocaine
        - CI: Hypotension/unstable
    - Immediate Cardioversion if amiodarone fails
- Pulse + Unstable and Sustained Monomorphic
    - Synchronized Cardioversion
        - Low energy shock to QRS complex that is timed
    - IV amiodarone to prevent VT/VF after Cardioversion
- Pulseless
    - 1) Defibrillation (unsynchronized Cardioversion)
        - High energy shock at a random point, multiple attempts
    - 2) Epinephrine every 3-5 mins
    - 3) Amiodarone/Lidocaine
- Chronic: ICD

### Slow Ventricular Tachycardias(40-150 BPM)

#### Ventricular escape (3rd degree AV Block)

#### Accelerated Ventricular Rhythm

#### Idioventricular

### Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)

- Chaotic, irregular waveform of varying shapes and amplitude
- No coordinated contractions, identifiable p waves, QRS, or T waves
- Very rapid, irregular polymorphic rhythm
    - Disorganized electrical activity with multiple rapidly firing foci in the ventricles (Ventricles can’t produce CO)
    - Diffuse wide QRS segments
    - Pulseless tachyarrhythmia
- Most begin with Vtach
- RF: IHD, antiarrhythmics, Atrial fib w/RVR
    - Common in patients with MI
    - Most common cause of SCD during acute MI
- Treatment
    - Immediate Defibrillation + CPR
        - IV Epinephrine or Vasopressin without interrupting CPR if 1st defibrillation doesn’t work
        - IV amiodarone
