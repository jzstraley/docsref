- Framingham Risk Stratification:
    - High Risk >3%:
        - Resting LVEF <35%
        - High risk treadmill score ≤-11
        - Exercise LVEF <35%
        - Stress induced large perfusion defect
        - Multiple, moderate-sized perfusion defects
        - Large, fixed perfusion defect with LV dilation or increased lung uptake
        - more than 2 segments of wall motion abnormalities on echo at low dobutamine does or low HR <102
        - Stress echo evidence of extensive ischemia
    - Intermediate Risk (1-3%):
        - Mild/moderate resting LV dysfunction (LVEF 35-49%)
        - Duke Treadmill -11 to 5
        - Stress induced moderate perfusion defect
        - ≤2 segments of wall motion abnormalities on echo at high dobutamine does or low HR <102
    - Low Risk (<1%)
        - Low risk Duke treadmill score ≥5
        - Normal or small defect at rest or with stress
        - Normal stress echo wall motion or no change of limited resting wall motion abnormalities during stress

### LOW-RISK STRESS FINDINGS (associated with a cardiac mortality of less than 1% per year)

- 1. Low risk treadmill score (score ≥ 5)
- 2. Normal or small myocardial perfusion defect at rest or with stress
- 3. Normal stress echocardiographic wall motion or no change of limited resting wall motion abnormalities during stress

### INTERMEDIATE-RISK STRESS FINDINGS (associated with a 1-3% per year cardiac mortality)

- 1. Mild/moderate resting left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35-49%)
- 2. Intermediate risk treadmill score (-11 score to < 5)
- 3. Stress-induced moderate perfusion defect without LV dilation or increased lung intake (thallium-201)

### HIGH-RISK STRESS FINDINGS (associated with a >3% per year cardiac mortality)

- 1. Severe resting left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%)
- 2. High-risk treadmill score (score ≤ -11)
- 3. Severe exercise left ventricular dysfunction (exercise LVEF < 35%)
- 4. Stress-induced large perfusion defect (particularly if anterior)
- 5. Stress-induced multiple perfusion defects of moderate size.
- 6. Large, fixed perfusion defect with LV dilation or increased lung uptake (Thallium-201)
- 7. Stress-induced moderate perfusion defect with LV dilation or increased lung uptake (thallium-201)

## Balanced Ischemia

- High risk features on Exercise testing
    - Coronary blood low is equally or nearly equally impaired
    - ST depression in multiple leads during peak stress but no evidence of ischemia on radionuclide MPI
