## Stress Testing

- Update on Stress Testing[^1]

### Exercise Treadmill Test

- [Pooled data][1]
    - Men: Sensitivity of 68% and Specificity of 77% for CAD
    - Women: Sensitivity of 61% and Specificity of 70% for CAD
- {==Not interpretable for ischemia if:==}
    - Old LBBB
    - Unable to reach target HR
    - Baseline ST elevation
    - Digoxin use
- Duke Treadmill Score = Exercise Time - 5x Maximal ST depressions - 4 x Angina Index
    - ≥5 is low risk
    - 4 to -10 is intermediate risk
    - ≤-11 is high risk
- Absolute Contraindication to EXERCISE Stress Testing (Use Drugs + Imaging)
    - Inability to exercise adequately due to physical or mental impairment (85% of predicted HR unable to be reached)
- Note:
    - ST depression <0.5 give 0 for DTS
    - Resting ST-segment depression <1mm increases test sensitivity but decreases specificity with no change in overall accuracy
    - Role less clear in RBBB
- Exercise Capacity is the highest prognostic impact marker during exercise testing including MPI variables irrespective of CAD severity, Gender, Age

### Stress Testing with Imaging

- Includes:
    - Exercise Nuclear Stress
    - Pharmacologic Nuclear Stress
    - Dobutamine Stress Echo
- Indications for Stress Testing with Imaging (MPI/Nuclear/SPECT, CMR, or Echo)
    - Indications:
        - Unable to exercise
        - Baseline EKG abnormalities limiting interpretation
            - LBBB, RBBB
        - Indeterminate findings on Exercise Stress Test
- SPECT (99mTc-Sestamibi/Tetrofosmin)
    - Thallium no longer used
    - [SPECT MPI](/fellowship-guide/topics/nuc/spect/)

### Pharmacologic Stress Testing

- Requires Imaging
- Indications
    - Unable/unwilling to exercise
    - Contraindication to exercise
        - AAA
        - Severe AS
        - HOCM
    - LBBB/Pacemaker
    - Interfering Medications
    - ACS
- Modes
    - Vasodilator (3.5-4x increase in myocardial blood flow)
        - Kinetics
            - Decrease SBP/DBP, increase HR
        - Medications
            - Dipyridamole
                - SE (50%)
            - Adenosine
                - 10 second half-life
                - 4 minute and 6 minute protocols
                - IV aminophylline reversal possible
                - SE (80%): CP (57%), Dyspnea (15%), Flushing (25%), Headache (35%), 2nd degree AV block in 4%
            - Regadenoson (Lexiscan)
                - EXERRT Trial: safe to combinding low-level exercise for better heart-to-gut/liver ratios
                - IV aminophylline reversal possible
                - SE (86%): Dyspnea (61%), Flushing (39%), Headache (35%), Dizziness (27%), CP (12%)
        - Absolute Contraindications
            - High-grade AV block or SSS <40
            - Active or severe bronchospasm (asthma, active wheezing)
            - Hypotension (stimulate A2A receptors on vascular smooth muscles, magnified from rest)/Hypertension >200/110
            - Caffeine within 12 hours
            - Theophylline within 48 hours
        - Relative Contraindications
            - Seizure disorder
            - Severe AS
            - Mobitz 1 2nd-degree AV block
        - Discontinue for:
            - Bronchospasm
            - SBP <80 mmHg
            - Persistent/symptomatic 2nd/3rd degree AV block
            - CP and ST depression >2mm
    - Dobutamine
        - Kinetics: Increase SBP and HR, Decrease DBP
        - USE: CI to Exercise and Vasodilator Stress Testing
        - SE(75%): Ischemic ST-depression (33%), CP (31%), Palpitations (29%), Significant SVT/VT (8-10%)

## {==Positive Findings==}

- ≥ 1mm of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression or elevation 8 ms after the J-point during exercise or recovery
- ≥1mm ST-elevation in a lead without a baseline Q-wave
- ≥1mm AVR elevation
- Ventricular Tachycardia
- more than 1.5-2mm of upsloping ST-segment depression 8 ms after the J-point during exercise or recovery

## Findings associated with poor outcomes

- Poor exercise capacity (<5 METs)
    - Patients achieving ≥10 METs have a 0.1%/year rate of cardiac death and 0.7%/year rate of nonfatal MI
- Exercise-induced angina during minimal expenditure
- Inability to achieve 85% age-predicted maximum HR with exercise
    - Calculated as (220 - Age)
- Fall in SBP below baseline during exercise
- ST elevation
- ≥ 2mm ST-depression during minimal expenditure
    - Maximum ST-segment deviation is a strong predictor of both cardiac death and composite cardiac death and nonfatal MI
- Early onset or prolonged duration of ST depression during testing
    - Rapid recovery is associated with a low rate of positive imaging or findings of CAD on angiography
- ST depression in multiple leads
- Ventricular couplets or tachycardia during minimal expenditure or recovery
