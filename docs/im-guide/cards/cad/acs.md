## Background

- Completely or partially occluding thrombus on a disrupted atherothrombotic coronary plaque leading to myocardial ischemia
- 30% mortality rate, half of which are pre-hospital
    - Decreased Cardiac Index, increased SVR, normal LVEDV
        - Acute or recent MI, CI is reduced due to myocardial dysfunction, SVR is increased to maintain organ perfusion
        - LVEDV remains relatively normal in the early phase before LV remodeling +/- dilatation occurs in the following weeks

## Types

- ACS Includes: Unstable Angina, NSTEMI, STEMI
    - Unstable Angina: Angina w/o evidence of myocardial necrosis (normal troponin + normal EKG)
    - NSTEMI: Evidence of myocardial necrosis (elevated troponin) w/o ST segment elevation
    - STEMI: Elevated troponin & elevation in ST segment or new LBBB with symptoms
        - ≥ 0.1 mV in at least 2 contiguous leads
        - Exception, in V2-V3:
            - ≥ 0.2 mV in men older than 40 y/o
            - ≥ 0.25 in men younger than 40 y/o
            - ≥ 0.15 mV in women

### Unstable Angina

- W/U: Troponins at 3-6 hours after symptoms onset, remeasure within 8-12
    - [HEART Score in the ER][11]
    - Risk Assessment ([TIMI Risk Score][12])
        - For TIMI, baseline needs to be normal
            - ≥65, 3x (hypertension, DM, Dyslipidemia, FH, Smoking), >50% coronary stenosis, ST segment change, multiple episodes of angina in a day, increased troponin, aspirin in last week
                - Associated with increased number of all cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring revascularization
            - ≤2 = Low: Conservative w/medical therapy + stress tests within 48 hours
                - <10% 2 weeks risk for serious event
                - BB + Nitro + Statins + Heparin + Ticagrelor + Aspirin
            - 3-4 = Intermediate: Early PCI within 24hrs
                - Within 25-72 hours and TIMI 3 or 4 score (intermediate): Invasive assessment + consider cath
            - ≥5 = High: PCI within 2 hours
- Management
    - Admission + Continuous Telemetry + O2 if needed
    - Unstable, HF, new MR, Recurrent CP, Ventricular Arrythmia: Immediate Coronary Angiography
    - Acute:
        - 1) 160-325mg Aspirin for all
        - 2) UFA w/bolus 60U/kg followed by infusion at 12U/kg/h or LMWH 1mg/kg
            - [UFA is preferred for ESRD][14]
        - 3) P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (Clopidogrel, Prasugrel), ticagrelor if PCI
        - 4) BB if no contraindications
            - Reduces infarct size, lowers risk of reinfarction and early mortality
            - CI: Decompensated HF, Bradycardia
        - IV Nitroglycerin at 10mcg/min
            - Keep BP >100-110 mmHg
        - GP IIBIIIA if PCI (Epitifibatide, Tirofiban)
    - Long Term:
        - Antiplatelet, ACEI, or ARB
        - ACEI (Lisinopril)
        - Clopidogrel reduces MI incidence + ASA for 12 months
        - BBs (metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol)
        - BP control (CCBs)
        - Statins, Quit Smoking
        - Diet and Diabetes Control
        - Exercise

### Acute Myocardial Infarction

- [Definition][3]
    - The term **acute myocardial infarction** should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia + detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL + least one of the following:
        - Symptoms of myocardial ischemia
        - New ischemic ECG changes
        - Development of pathological Q waves
        - Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology
        - Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for type 2 or 3 MIs)
    - Post-mortem demonstration of acute atherothrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI
    - Evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute atherothrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI
    - Cardiac death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemia ECG changes before cTn values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI

### NSTEMI

- W/U: Troponins at 3-6 hours after symptoms onset, remeasure within 8-12 HEART Score in the ER
    - [HEART Score in the ER][11]
    - Risk Assessment ([TIMI Risk Score][12])
        - GRACE score predicts in-hospital and 6 month mortality
- Treatment
    - Initial Stabilization
        - Aspirin: 325mg chewed immediately, 81mg QD
            - If no aspirin initially: 300mg followed by 75mg daily
            - If UA or NSTEMI: UFA: Bolus of 12-55 U/kg/min up to 60-70 U/kg/min maintained at 1.5-2.5x PTT for 2-5days
        - 0.4mg sublingual nitrogen +/- 10 microg/min and increased by 5-10 microgram/min every 3-5 min until relief (200 usual max) for 12-24 hours
        - IV Metoprolol: 5mg IV Q5minx3, then 25-50mg Q6hrPO

                - Higher rate of recurrent MI, Intracranial Hemorrhage, Mortality
        - NSTE-ACS + Low-Risk: Ischemia-Guided Strategy
            - Noninvasive stress testing prior to discharge
        - NSTE-ACS + High Risk (Refractory angina, HF, Arrythmia or Hemodynamic instability)
            - Urgent cath
    - Long-Term
        - ACEI if LVD, DM, Hypertension
        - Therapeutic ACEI + BB + LVEF ≤40 + (DM or HF): Eplerenone is beneficial

### STEMI

- General
    - Usually due to ruptured/eroded or unstable atherosclerotic plaques with overlying thrombus formation, leading to reduced coronary blood flow
    - [2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction][13]
    - Cardiogenic shock is leading cause of death, 50%
        - [Restoration of Coronary blood flow (PCI > Fibrinolysis)][15]
            - Most likely to improve CV and overall long-term mortality in Acute STEMI
            - SHOCK Trial
- Symptoms
    - Pale, sweaty, may be agitated or restless
    - Crushing, pressure like substernal chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis, and sometimes a history of exertional chest pain
    - Often radiates down the left arm or into the jaw
        - Aortic Dissection more likely if radiation to the back
    - If recurrent MI:
        - Dyspnea and wheezing
            - Indicate LV impairment and pulmonary edema
        - Bibasilar rales +/- JVD
    - RVMI usually have hypotension, JVD, clear lungs (inferior MI MC)
        - If RVMI w/hypotension, low-normal JVD, then give IV saline Bolus for inadequate RV preload, avoid nitrates
- Exam
    - Arrythmia, heart block, sinus tachycardia (Prior to BBs)
    - JVP
    - MR w/soft S1 and pansystolic murmur
    - VSD
    - Pericardial friction rub
    - Aortic dissection
- Diagnosis: EKG + Trops
    - EKG
        - ST-elevation at the J-point in 2 contiguous leads with the cut point: ≥1mm in all leads other than V2-V3 where the following cut-points apply:
            - ≥2mm in men ≥40y
            - ≥2.5mm in men <40y
            - ≥1.5mm in women of any age
        - Depression
            - New horizontal or downsloping ST-depression ≥0.5mm in 2 continguous leads and/or T inversion ≥1mm in two contiguous leads with prominent R wave or R/S ratio >1.
                - 1mm in two or more contiguous limb or chest leads, 2mm elevation in leads V2/V3 in men or 1.5mm in women.
            - Posterior: 2mm in anterior V1-V4 with tall R waves often with ST-segment elevation in the inferior or lateral leads and ST elevation in posterior V7-V9
    - Myoglobin rises within 1h of onset, peak at 6h, normal in 1 day
    - CK-MB rises within 4-6h, peak at 1 day, normal in 2-3 days
    - Troponin rises within 2-6h, peaks 2 days, normal in 4-10 days
        - Good in both acute and recent Mis
        - Most sensitive and specific
- Acute ST-Segment Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
    - Anterior Wall STEMI
        - Heart Failure
            - Flash pulmonary edema
                - Loop Diuretic (Furosemide), relieves pulmonary edema by decreasing the cardiac preload
                - Venodilation, which further decreases the preload
                - Hypotension and AKI if normo/hypovolemic (aka be careful)
    - Inferior Wall STEMI (Inferior MI)
        - General
            - ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF
            - Usually due to occlusion of the RCA > LCX
        - Transient Bradycardia or AV block
            - Treatment
                - Usually just Atropine
                - Temporary pacemaker possibly
        - Right Ventricular MI (RVMI)
            - 30-50% of Acute inferior wall Mis
                - Due to occlusion of the proximal RCA before the origin of the RV branches
            - Leads to impaired RV filling and often creates high sensitivity to intravascular volume depletion
                - Decreased preload and CO
                - Not observed in a pure LVMI
            - Clear lungs + Inferior wall MI indicate RVMI
            - Exam
                - Distended neck veins (JCD), clear lungs, tachycardia
                - Hypotension + low/normal JVP (≤3cm above the sternal angle) suggest Cardiogenic Shock
                    - Due to inadequate RV preload
                    - Bolus with Isotonic Saline to increase RV preload and improve CO
                    - Avoid Beta blockers
                    - Beta blockers contraindicated in bradycardia or cardiogenic shock
                - Hypotension in Right Ventricular MI with low-normal JVP
                    - CVP = JVP + depth to right atrium (5cm)
                        - 30-45 degrees, sternal angle
                        - Normal CVP (6-8 cm H2O)
                        - Elevated CVP (>8 cm H2O)
                    - Indicates inadequate RV preload
                    - IV saline bolus (avoid nitrates)
            - Diagnosis: V4 on R-sided EKG is 100% specific (V4-V6R)
            - Treatment
                - Initial IV Normal Saline Bolus
                - Vigorous fluid resuscitation
                    - +/- Dopamine/dobutamine if refractory
                - Manage Like an Acute STEMI after
                - Diuretics (volume depletion) and opiates (venous dilation) should be avoided or used in caution
                - Avoid Nitrates
                    - Nitrates (venous dilation) will lead to profound hypotension due to decreased RV preload
- Treatment
    - Goal: Decrease Cardiac Myocardial O2 and increase O2 delivery
        - Emergent PCI has shown to have higher rates of survival in active STEMI and Cardiogenic shock than ICU stabilization initially
        - [2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization][19]
    - [ACC/AHA guideline update for the management of STEMI][18]
    - General
        - To reduce morbidity and mortality
            - Aspirin + Clopidogrel, ticagrelor + BB + ACEI/ARB + Statins +/- Aldosterone antagonists
        - ACEI: LV dysfunction, HF, EF ≤40%, Anterior wall infarction, diabetes
            - Give ACEI/ARB within 24h to limit Ventricular Remodeling (AT2 mediated), results in dilatation of the ventricle
            - [SAVE][7]: ACEI improve survival/morbidity/mortality in LV dysfunction after MI
        - If Pulmonary Edema w/o hypotension or hypovolemic: IV Furosemide
    - 1) Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT)
        - P2Y12s
            - [PLATO][1]: Ticagrelor > Clopidogrel in ACS including mortality
            - [DAPT][2]: Continuing Thienopyridine after 12 months decreased risk of In-stent thrombosis and MI at 18 months, increased risk of bleeding
            - [WOEST][4]: Bleeding w/AC + Plavix < Triple Therapy w/o change in MI/Stroke/MACE
            - [COGENT][5]: PPI with DAPT reduces GIB 87%, no CV event change
        - Acute Recommendations
            - Give chewable Aspirin (325mg) at presentation
            - P2Y12 Receptor Blocker (Clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor)
                - If PCI: Loading dose of Clopidogrel 600mg or Ticagrelor 180mg
                - If Fibrinolytics: Clopidogrel 300mg; 75mg if >75y/o
            - PPI if on DAPT and high-risk for bleeding (previous bleed, PUD, active H. Pylori, Age >65)
                - Decreases risk of UGIB
                - Avoid Omeprazole if on Strong CYP2C19 (Plavix), use Protonix/Dexlansoprazole
                    - Does not affect prasugrel or ticagrelor
        - Duration Recommendations
            - DAPT for minimum of 6-12 months after BMS/DES Placement
                - Postpone elective surgeries until done with DAPT
                - Can stop P2Y12 3-7 days prior to surgery
                - [Continue aspirin perioperatively unless Neurosurgery][20]
            - DAPT for 6 months if no stent w/ACS
            - DAPT for ≥12 months for drug-eluting stent in ACS
                - Clopidogrel or Ticagrelor
                - Restart ASA after cessation of P2Y12
                - Premature discontinuation is the strongest predictor of stent thrombosis within 1st 12 months
            - DAPT > 1 year if: high risk for recurrence, depressed LV function, Saphenous vein graft stenting, diabetic
                - In whom the risk < benefit for up to 36m
                - May use DAPT bleeding risk score
                - Clopidogrel if hx of upper gi bleed
            - DAPT for minimum of 4 weeks in select patients after BMS
                - Use in pts with high bleeding risk
            - Continue DAPT for a total of 30 months if possible (Low bleeding risk)
            - Continue Aspirin Indefinitely
            - CAD + PAD
                - COMPASS Trial: Aspirin 100mg + Xarelto 2.5mg BID improves MACE
            - PCI
                - [Prasugrel associated with increased bleeding, similar efficacy in those with stents][17]
            - Perioperative Management
                - Elective Surgery: Defer Surgery until after minimum DAPT duration
                    - Urgent Surgery: Continue P2Y12 receptor blacker or hold for shortest duration possible
                    - Continue aspirin unless high risk of severe surgical bleeding
                    - Reduces rate of early graft occlusion and overall CV morbidity and mortality in CABG, continue
                    - Hold P2Y12 inhibitors for 5-7 days prior to CABG
                    - Increased risk of significant bleeding with increased requirements for blood transfusion and possible re-op
    - 2) Beta-blockers (BBs) if Hypertensive/ongoing (Metoprolol)
        - Beta-Blockers not always needed (*New*)
            - [Did not lead to a lower risk of the composite primary end point of death from any cause or new myocardial infarction than no beta-blocker][9]
            - Decrease myocardial demand, reduce incidence of ventricular arrythmias, improve long-term survival within 24 hours of presentation
        - Oral only, IV has no benefit
        - CI: HF, High risk for Shock, Bradycardia, hypotension, heart block
            - Atropine if unstable sinus bradycardia
    - 3) O2 for arterial saturation <90% (SaO2 <95%, breathless, or HF)
    - 4) IV Opioids to relieve pain if needed
    - 5) Anticoagulation
        - If PCI: UFH, Enoxaparin, or Bivalirudin
            - +/- Glycoprotein IIb/IIa inhibitor to UFH
            - Determine Need for ongoing anticoagulation after
                - Low risk: Stop IV UFH after cath
                    - Low VTE risk: SCDs
                    - Intermediate/High VTE risk: Give lovenox 6hr after stopping drip

    - 7) High dose Statins ASAP after stabilization (Atorvastatin 80mg)
        - [PROVE-IT][6]: Significantly reduced CVD events following MI with High-dose Lipitor vs. Pravastatin
        - Want LDL < 70 1 month after
    - 8) Prompt reperfusion with PCI or Alteplase (fibrinolytics)
        - [Early Invasive Strategy][10]
        - Give IV UFH/Bivalirudin
            - Abciximab
        - PCI > Fibrinolysis (Alteplase, not for NSTEMI or Unstable)
        - Ideal first medical contact to PCI ≤90mins or ≤30mins for fibrinolytics
        - Avoid Milrinone and Dobutamine in Acute STEMI
            - Increases mortality in cardiogenic shock, may cause hypotension
            - Use Norepinephrine if hypotensive
    - Reperfusion:
        - Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA)
        - Thrombolysis (If PTCA not available within 120min)
    - TIMI Grade
        - Used to quantitatively evaluate coronary blood flow
        - 0 = complete occlusion
        - 1 = faint coronary flow
        - 2 = delayed or sluggish but complete flow
        - 3 = normal flow
    - Initiate Reperfusion Therapy (Fibrinolysis/PCI) < 12 hours of symptom onset and within 90 minutes of medical contact (120 if transporting)
        - Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)
            - PCI = Angioplasty + Stent
    - < 12 hours of symptom onset + PCI CI or > 12 hours of symptom onset
        - Thrombolysis
        - No PCI: Fibrinolytics within 30 mins of arrival
            - Absolute CI to fibrinolytics:
                - Ischemic stroke within 3 months, Intracranial Hemorrhage ever
            - Relative CI:
                - Ischemic stroke >3 months, SBP > 180, elevated INR on warfarin
                    - Can still get FT
            - Better if used within 12 hours, best within 60-70 minutes
            - DAPT for at least 14 days up to 1 year
    - Aldosterone antagonist if:
        - NYHA II-IV HF & EF ≤35%

                - Improves mortality and morbidity
                - Avoid if Cr <30, Hyperkalemia
    - On Discharge:
        - Cardiac Rehabilitation for those with PCI
    - Eval for ICD if reduced EF after 40 days or 3 months after revascularization on optimal medical therapy
        - [MADIT-II][8]: ICD improves survival in pts with prior MI and severe LV dysfunction
    - Non-Culprit lesions
        - 50% of STEMI have obstructive lesions remote form the area of infarction
            - Consider revascularization
        - Treat within 4-6 weeks if stable STEMI or low-complexity MCVD

## Complications

- Prognostic
    - The higher LVEF post MI, the better the prognosis
- Post MI
    - Sexual activity: 2 weeks if healthy, 6 weeks if not
        - ED and decreased satisfaction are common, PDE-5s if not on nitrates
- Pericardial Effusion
    - Stop all AC unless Afib or LV thrombus
- Post-PCI
    - Reperfusion leading to contraction band necrosis from calcium influx
- 3 Major Mechanical Complications
    - MR due to Papillary muscle rupture
    - LV free wall rupture

                - Most common fatal
            - Immediate (<10mins): Acute ischemia predisposes to reentrant arrythmias
                - Ventricular Fibrillation is the MCC of SCD during acute MI
            - Delayed (10-60mins): Abnormal automaticity leads to arrythmias
        - Cardiogenic Shock
            - Severe SOB, chest pain, decreased CO, increased PCWP (indicates cardiac), causes pulmonary edema
        - Congestive Heart Failure
