## Etiology

- Obstruction of blood flow in a coronary artery lumen, most commonly due to coronary artery atherosclerosis

## Major RF: HLD, HTN, Smoking, DM, FH, Age >45M or 55F

- Premature CAD: 1st degree male relative diagnosed age <50 y/o or female <60 y/o
- SLE is a known risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and premature CHD

## Symptoms

- Subclinical or Asymptomatic CAD
    - Evidence of CAD w/o symptoms

## Complications

- Heart Failure
    - IHD/CAD = 60-75% of cases in developing world
- Cardiac Ischemia
    - Unstable Angina: Mural thrombus
    - Acute MI: Results from acute thromboses after plaque disruption
    - SCD: Usually from fatal arrhythmia
    - Chronic Stable Angina

## Management

- Give all CAD patients Statins
    - Reduced risk of death by 24%, reduced risk of stroke by 31%, and reduction in need for CABG or Coronary Angioplasty by 27%
- Aspirin for secondary prevention
    - Increased risk of Thromboembolic events if stopped, 70% occur within 7-10 days
