### Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)

- Etiology
    - Usually closes after birth, adults are usually asymptomatic
    - 80% of neonates <1200 grams
    - Hemodynamically significant
    - F>M
    - Need antibiotic prophylaxis if unrepaired and complicated by Eisenmenger syndrome or cyanotic pulmonary hypertension, or within 6 months of surgical repair, or residual deficit after surgery
- Murmur
    - Continuous machine-like murmur
    - Best heard over left upper sternal border
        - Small: Left infraclavicular region
        - Moderate: wide pulse pressure, bounding pulses, laterally displaced apical impulse
        - Large: LV overload in early childhood
            - Tachycardia, dyspnea, poor growth
    - Left to right shunt
        - Loudest at S2
    - May radiate to the back
- Symptoms
    - Differential Cyanosis
        - Clubbed toes, normal fingers
    - May develop pulmonary vascular congestion and eventual RHF
    - May develop Endarteritis
- Diagnosis
    - CXR: Calcification of the ductus arteriosus in adults
- Complications
    - [Bacterial Endocarditis/Infective endarteritis][1] (PDA-related Endocarditis)
    - Eisenmenger Syndrome
        - Right to left shunting
    - Pulmonary Hypertension
    - Irreversible pulmonary vascular obstructive disease
- Treatment
    - Prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) to keep it open until surgical intervention
    - Indomethacin < Ibuprofen
        - Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor
    - more than 2 weeks: Unlikely to close, Surgical closure
    - more than 6-8 months: Surgery
    - Adults: Surgical, endovascular approach to close

### Anomalous Coronary Artery

- 2nd mcc of SCD with strenuous exercise in athletes behind HCM (17%)
    - Usually, benign retroaortic course and 30-40 y/o
- Symptoms
    - Exertional chest pain, syncope during exercise in a young individual
        - Exertional syncope is never normal
- Diagnosis: Coronary CTA or MRA
