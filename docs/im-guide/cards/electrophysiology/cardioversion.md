## External Direct Current Cardioversion

* Indications
  * Persistent Afib
* Considered successful if sinus rhythm of any duration is achieved post cardioversion
  * Unsuccessful in >10%
    * More likely to fail if:
      * BMI ≥30, ≥35, ≥40 are associated with 1.87, 2.50, and 4.9 Relative risk of requiring more than one attempt[^1]
* [Predictors of recurrence after catheter ablation and electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: an umbrella review of meta-analyses][3]
  * Address HTN, OSA, Depression, Metabolic Syndrome
  * AADs may increase the success rate of DC cardioversion
* [Amiodarone pretreatment with intravenous bolus few hours before electrical cardioversion reduces short-term recurrences of atrial fibrillation][4]

## Setup

* Goal: Optimize Transthoracic Impedance
  * Determined by position of the electrodes
    * The lower the better
    * Optimal when atria completely encompassed
  * [RAFF2][1]: No difference between AP vs. AL pad locations in achieving cardioversion success
    * [AP to have better success over AL in patients with lone AF and LA size <45mm][2]

## [Protocol][^1]

1) 200J AP Biphasic Shock
2) #1 + External Compression (60-100N) at end-expiration
3) #2 but anterior pad changed to right parasternal location
4) Use 2 defibrillators with crossing pad in AP and right parasternal to deliver 400J shock with external compression at end-expiration
5) Position pads under fluoroscopy

## Complications

* Asystole >5s
* Severe Transient Bradycardia w/HR <40 bmp (<1%)
* Sustained ventricular arrhythmia
