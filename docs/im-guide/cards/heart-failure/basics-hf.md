## General

- [Definition][11]: Any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill or to eject blood
    - Inability of the heart to adequately perfuse the body leading to congestion
    - Any condition that leads to an alteration in LV dysfunction (structure or function) can predispose one to developing HF
    - HF preferred over CHF because Congestive Heart Failure fails to include high-output states

## [Physiology][3]

- [Physiology of Diuretics in Acute Heart Failure][4]

## Etiology

- CAD is MCC in US (>50%)
- 20% of Americans â‰¥40 y/o develop
    - AA males have highest risk and highest 5-year mortality

## Types

- [Acute][1]
- [Chronic][2]
- Generally, 3 Classes of HF:
    - Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)
        - Important in classification
        - Acute is classified based on:
            - Congestion (wet vs. dry) and Perfusion (warm vs. cold)
- A) HFrEF
    - Systolic Dysfunction, EF â‰¤40%
    - Mcly due to ischemic heart disease (MC) and dilated cardiomyopathy
- B) HFpEF
    - Diastolic Dysfunction, EF â‰¥50%
- C) High-output Failure
    - Occurs in the setting of existing systolic or diastolic dysfunction

## Classification Systems

- NYHA Classifications
    - Class I
        - Cardiac Disease but without restriction
    - Class II
        - Slight limitation of physical activity
        - Comfortable at rest
        - Fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain
        - 5-10% of NYHA class II die yearly
    - Class III
        - Marked limitation of physical activity
        - Comfortable at rest
        - Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain
    - Class IV
        - Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort
        - HF symptoms or anginal syndrome may be present even at rest
        - Physical activity makes it worse
        - 30-70% of NYHA class IV die yearly
- ACC/AHA Staging
    - Stage A
        - High risk for HF but no structural heart disease, including:
            - HTN, Atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiotoxins, FH of cardiomyopathy
            - Means having HTN you have Stage A HF
        - Treatment
            - Treat the disorder
            - Exercise can decrease all cause death or hospitalization (HF-ACTION Trial) up to 11%
            - ACEIs/ARBs in select patients
    - Stage B
        - Structural heart disease w/o symptoms, including:
            - Previous MI, valvular disease, and LVH or low LVEF
        - Treatment
            - ACEIs/ARBs
            - BBs + Statins if MI/ACS
            - ICD if indicated
    - Stage C
        - Structural heart disease with current or prior HF symptoms
        - Treatment
            - NYHA II-IV
                - Loop diuretics
            - NYHA III-IV + AA
                - Hydralazine/Isosorbide Dinitrate
            - NYHA II-IV + Cr >30 and K <5
                - Aldosterone antagonists
            - Stage A and B drugs
    - Stage D
        - Marked symptoms at rest
        - Treatment
            - As above + ICD, heart transplant

## Symptoms

- Fatigue and SOB
- Progressive Dyspnea with Exercise
    - Origin: Most important mechanism is pulmonary congestion with accumulation of interstitial or intra-alveolar fluid
        - Stimulate the rapid, shallow breathing characteristic of cardiac dyspnea
        - Pulmonary compliance reduction, Increased airway resistance, Anemia
        - Less frequent with onset of RV failure and TR
    - JVD, Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea, peripheral edema, S3, orthopnea
    - Cough if present is productive

## Diagnosis: Clinical

- Best Test: Get Echocardiogram (Transthoracic Echocardiogram)
    - To distinguish between Systolic and Diastolic HF
- Cardiomegaly on CXR
- Labs: CXR, EKG, CBC w/Diff, UA, UM, Electrolytes + Calcium and magnesium
    - BUN/Cr, Glucose, Lipids, LFTs, TSH, BNP or NT-proBNP
    - Troponin-I

## Prognosis

- [On GDMT of ARNI/BB/MRA/SGLT2i][12]
    - Estimated 7.9, actual 4.9 years gained for a 50 y/o with HFrEF
    - Estimated 5.0, actual 3.3 years gained for a 70 y/o with HFrEF
