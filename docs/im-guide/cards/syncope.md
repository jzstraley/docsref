- W/U: H+P, EKG, Labs (CBC, CMP, SaO2, Cardiac Enzymes)  
    - Recurrent syncope, cardiac cause ruled out, atypical presentation, high risk occupation with single episode: Tilt-table tasting
        - 26-80% sensitive, 90% specific
    - Admit if any High risk (ROSE rule, BRACES):
        - High-Risk Features(≥1 feature increases the short-term risk of significant death or arrythmia)
            - Abnormal EKG (new change)
                - Diagnosis in 60%
            - History of structural heart disease or heart failure
                - Aortic Stenosis
            - Systolic BP <90mmHg at triage
            - Associated shortness of breath during syncope
            - Hematocrit <30%
            - Advanced age with CV co-morbidities
            - Family history of sudden cardiac death
        - BNP ≥300
