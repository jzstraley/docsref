## Medication Reconciliation (Discharge)
    - Navigate to the Med Rec as seen in “How to Admit a Patient”<br>
    - With your Senior, complete the Med Rec for discharge
		i. This is the main opportunity to stop or change medications for the patient after discharge
	- Once this step is completed, you will see the "check" beside Home Medications as below.

## Patient Instructions/Follow-Ups/Education
- Navigate to the Inpatient Workflow Discharge Platinum and select the “Patient Instructions”<br>

<br>

<br>

- The instructions can be done multiple ways and as long as you communicate to the patient what needs to be done, you can do this as you like. I utilize the Uptodate method to break it down into simple easy to digest steps. I then saved it as a dotphrase .jsdischargeinstructions
    - Just make sure to save this field as it will autopopulate into your Discharge summary
    - Anywhere within the Instructions field, press Ctrl + A, then Ctrl + C<br>

<br>

- Make sure to complete the Follow-ups and Patient education on the same page as you go
    - Follow-ups are typically with the patient’s PCP, generally I have them follow up within a few days to 10 days depending on the condition.
        - Option 1) Patient’s PCP is a random person somewhere else
            - It is not required, but encouraged to notify them about their patient needing a follow up
        - Option 2) Patient is established with Dr. Aman, Dr. Hadley, Dr. John, Dr. Durden, or Dr. Griffith
            - You will need to Select “Communicate and Message” at the top of the page to create a new message for their clinic
            - To do so:<br>

    <br>

    - Send this message
        - Option 3) Patient is OPCC Resident’s patient
            - Same process as above but will select “MEM Outpatient Care Center – TCM” as the message recipient
        - NOTE: Do not schedule TCM visits if the patient is going to a SNF
    - Patient Education is to be selected based on relevance to their condition
        - Ex. Pt admitted for AECOPD could be given information on signs and symptoms of COPD exacerbation or the ALA’s information on grading their COPD exacerbation severity


## Discharge Instructions
- Prior to generating the Discharge Instructions, make sure the Home Medications, Follow-Up, and Patient Education tabs have the green check mark beside them in the Inpatient Discharge MPage. The Order Profile should still have the red star.
- Now it is time to create the patient’s discharge instructions
    - Type: Discharge Instructions
    - Note Template: Free Text Note
    - Title: “CAMC IM Discharge Instructions”<br>

    <br>

    ![Picture 2](../assets/images/internguidepages/1.5/1.5.3-picture2.png) 
    <br>

- Now, at the bottom there will be my generic instructions, delete those and press Ctrl + P
- This should paste the modified instructions from your instructions tab you completed in the previous step.
- Sign and Print this page. You will give this to the patient.

## Discharge Summary
- “Discharge summaries are to be done within 36 hours of discharge or prior to transferring a patient to another facility”
- A discharge summary can replace a progress note for the day
    - Ex. Discharge Mr. Hill at 2pm and complete discharge summary = no need for progress note that day
- Type: Discharge Summary
- Note Template: Inpatient Discharge Summary
- Title: “CAMC IM Discharge Summary”
