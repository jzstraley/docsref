    - If you are on the ICU and you are transferring a patient to the medicine service, contact the medicine service senior or MAO to transfer the patient
    - Other than a standard progress note, no extra note needs to be written if you are the "discharging" team
    - If you are on the medicine service and transferring to the ICU, a short progress note about the patient's decompensation should be written.
        - The ICU team will write an ICU Admission note rather than transfer note because it's special
