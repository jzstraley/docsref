## Working Smarter in Cerner

- Cerner is an EMR  
  - Powerful in some ways, inefficient in others  

- Computers excel at scale and repetition  
  - They struggle with nuance, ambiguity, and multivariable reasoning  

- Use that difference strategically  
  - Let the system handle repetitive, automatable tasks  
  - Preserve your cognitive bandwidth for clinical synthesis and decision-making  
  - Use dictation, dotphrases, shortcuts, and favorites deliberately  
  - Offload redundancy so you can think at a higher level  

- Cerner will not optimize itself  
  - It defaults to inefficiency unless you configure it  
  - The modules below are designed to help you customize Cerner so it works for you, not against you

## Proxy

### CERNER Proxy Setup Instructions

- To ensure safe patient care and equitable workload distribution, all residents must maintain active proxy coverage for their CERNER Message Center during vacation or leave.

- Vacation requests will not be approved without documented coverage.
  - Coverage must be identified on the Internal Medicine Time Off Request Form.
  - The covering resident must sign the form prior to submission.
  - Each resident is responsible for assigning proxy access in CERNER to the designated covering resident.
  - Proxy access must be configured no later than the day before the start of vacation or away rotation.

- If you are the covering resident:
  - You are responsible for confirming proxy access is active.
  - If you later become unavailable, you must secure alternate coverage for both residents involved.

- A brief tutorial (approximately two minutes) outlining how to assign proxy access within the CERNER Message Center is available here:  
  [Tutorial][3]

- If you encounter technical issues with proxy assignment, contact a fellow resident or the clinic chief before leaving.

- Failure to maintain appropriate proxy coverage may result in deficiencies attributed to one or both residents, depending on circumstances.

- The Message Center tab does not visually change when new messages arrive.
  - It must be checked routinely.
