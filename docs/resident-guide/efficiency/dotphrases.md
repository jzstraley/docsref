- Dotphrases are autotext commands you can use to quickly insert text or data.
- Data can be imported from the chart in the form of "Tokens" or "Smart Templates"
  - I will denote these with { } in this guide. Typing the text between these will not work. You must select the appropriate token
- If used correctly, they can literally save your life (and maybe your patient's)
  - In the menu bar, find the "Auto Text Copy Utility"
  - Search "Straley, James" on the left hand side
  - Copy the following dotphrases but rename them with your own initials
    - Ex. For Dr. Ball, he could name them any one of the following ways:
      - .abappointment
      - /docsabappointment

### .edlegswelling

Key diagnoses considered for leg swelling include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cellulitis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and lymphedema. DVT is less likely given the absence of recent immobilization or surgery, no history of venous thromboembolic disease, and no associated pain or tenderness. Cellulitis is less likely given the absence of skin warmth, erythema, or tenderness. CHF is less likely given the absence of associated symptoms such as dyspnea, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Lymphedema is less likely given the absence of chronicity, non-pitting nature of the swelling, and absence of associated skin changes.
