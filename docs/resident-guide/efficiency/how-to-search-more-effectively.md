## How to Search Efficiently Online

Here's a guide that showcase many useful search operators that you can use to search things online more efficiently.

## Exclude a Term From Your Search

Add a `-` before the word to exclude.

``` markdown
dolphins -football
```

You'll get animals, not a football team.

## If You Want Synonyms in the Result

Add a `~` before the word if you want synonyms.

``` markdown
music ~classes
```

Here you'll get music classes, lessons, coaching, etc.

## Search Within a Specific Website

How to search inside a specific website → `site:`reddit.com

``` markdown
How to do that site:reddit.com
```

## Or and |

How to use **OR** while searching ? → `OR` or `|`

``` markdown
Netflix | Prime <=> Netflix OR Prime
```

## Search Within Two Number Ranges

How to search within a range ? → `1993..2000`

``` markdown
Movies 1993..2000
```

## Find News Related to a Particular Location

How to search inside a specific location only ? → `location:`Charleston

``` markdown
Weather alert location:Charleston
```

## Filter by File Type

How to search for a specific filetype ? → `filetype:`pdf

``` markdown
ACC Heart Failure Guidelines filetype:pdf
```

## Searching for Exact Words

How to search for instances of a word? → `"word"`

``` markdown

## Eliminate Sites That Flood the Results
