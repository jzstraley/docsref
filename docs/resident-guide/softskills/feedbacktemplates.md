He/She is exceptionally inclusive, hard-working, and consistently exhibits curiosity and motivation to learn. He/She comes prepared for all types of learning situations, having researched the relevant topics so that he/she can provide quality care and participate to a degree beyond his/her required level. I would highly recommend his/her for whichever field he/she chooses.
- [] demonstrated an exceptional fund of knowledge and he/she applied his/her understanding at the bedside in managing our patients with the level of skill we typically see in a second-year resident.
- He/She was well prepared with all the information needed to formulate treatment plans and his/her ability to prioritize and integrate bits of evidence into a cohesive and logical story was especially noteworthy.

He/She initiated literature searches to supplement his/her understanding and to address questions raised by the team.

## Great - Medical Student

- [] did a stellar job on his/her rotation. Attending physicians he/she worked with commented on his/her teamwork, broad knowledge, and impressive procedural skills. He/She thoroughly reviewed patient records ahead of time, gathered appropriately focused histories, performed a targeted physical examination, presented in a well-organized and thoughtful manner, and wrote excellent notes. He/She was able to independently synthesize the information to formulate his/her own assessment and plan, often requiring little modification by the attending. His/her knowledge level exceeds expectations. He/She worked well with all members of the team.
- Many people commented that they hoped he’d consider family medicine for a specialty as he/she seemed to fit in and responded well to patients of all ages.
    - His/her understanding of the core content of family medicine, principles of preventive care, and his/her ability to put patients at ease during the exam were beyond what was expected at his/her level of training.
- [] is a bright, hardworking, and capable medical student who approached this rotation with diligence and attention. Patients responded well to his/her calm demeanor, and his/her interpersonal skills reflected his/her maturity and thoughtfulness. I greatly appreciated his/her enthusiasm for the work, and he/she asked excellent questions to enhance his/her understanding of his/her patients, systems issues, and the consultation model. He/She demonstrated a strong fund of knowledge throughout the rotation, and his/her thoughtfulness about clinical care was consistently reflected in his/her notes. His/Her assessments accurately and coherently laid out the differential diagnoses for his/her patients and the reasoning behind them. He/She gave an extremely interesting and thought provoking presentation on XX disorder. He/She was a true asset to our team, and an absolute pleasure to work with during this rotation.
- [] written notes were detailed, organized and flowed logically. They contained accurate assessments and plans for moderately complex patients. Typical's oral presentations exceeded those of his/her peers in their organization, succinctness of delivery and command of his/her patients’ medical information. Typical collaborated extremely well on all of his/her health care teams. He/She won praise for his/her dedication to his/her patients and his/her ability to develop a quick and meaningful rapport with them and their families. Several patients even requested him/her to be at their bedside. He/She was proactive and could be relied upon to efficiently obtain H&Ps on the busy Labor and Delivery floor or in the outpatient clinic. Typical’s energy and enthusiasm was appreciated by all who worked with him/her. He/She took ownership of his/her patients and kept the team updated with their progress. His/Her fund of knowledge was very good. Typical's technical skills and dexterity were good and improved steadily over the course of the rotation. Classmates found him/her to be an exceptional teammate, always willing to work hard for the needs of the team, discuss patients, and they commented that he/she was “a role model for great communication skills.” Nursing evaluators noted that he/she “caters to patients needs and is very helpful to the team” and “had a great bedside manner”. Patients found him/her to be warm and supportive.
- [ ] immerses himself in solving clinical problems, and is persistent until he/she has found answers. He/She worked with a very complicated diagnostic problem of a middle-aged woman with a high sedimentation rate and serositis where the differential diagnosis and the number of consultants became extensive. He/She went out of his/her way to coordinate with consultants, residents and staff the multiple complex input and problems in his/her patient, and he/she benefited as a result.
- [ ] stood out to me amongst the other third-year students immediately through [] curiosity and dedication to hard work.
- Throughout [] time on the team, many patients remarked on what a joy it was to interact with [] on a daily basis.
- [ ] always went beyond the average to gather data from multiple sources, and interpret and present it in a way that could be easily understood and used. After examining a patient with acute biliary colic, for example, he/she researched the available imaging modalities, learned why sonography was the recommended initial study, and presented this information to the group. [ ], as a result, learned much about the interpretation of sonographic images of the gall bladder.

## Average - Resident - Senior

- Balancing task delegation and orders could be more efficient, but I believe this is something all seniors go through and that it will become better with more time as a senior.

## Average - Resident - Intern

- Dr. [] performed at the level expected of a beginning-of-year PGY-1. He/She consistently attended to fundamental patient safety behaviors such as hand hygiene. He/She elicited and addressed patient concerns in a way that demonstrated compassion (e.g. talking with a patient about their diagnosis after rounds). Dr. [] actively sought feedback and consistently attempted to incorporate feedback into his/her daily workflow. He/She showed good judgment, and his/her medical knowledge is strong. He/She is working on how to effectively discharge patients and build an effective daily workflow. He/She was occasionally late, but showed improvement by rotation's end. For points of feedback, I would recommend spending less time "pre-rounding" initially. It is more efficient to quickly run over the morning labs and then trying to see the patients as the nurse's shift change is at 7:00am. If you're able to see your patients before then, you get a better report about overnight events from the night nurse. Overall, I think he/she will be a good intern by year's end.

## Poor - Attending

- Dr. X is not fit for the teaching service and should not be assigned residents or medical students. For the vast majority of my time with him/her he/she was condescending, rude, and not interested in answering questions or providing meaningful feedback. His/Her actions are unequivocally abusive and should not be tolerated at any institution. The only teaching obtained was self-guided via UpToDate or other online resources.

## Poor - Student

- [] had a consistent problem with being punctual in the mornings, although that did improve by the end of the rotation. His/Her motivation was fair, but most previous students have been more ambitious.
