## Teaching

- As seniors, it’s now your responsibility to help with teaching during and after rounds
- This is for your benefit as well as the interns/med students
- Typically like to have medical students on med service research a topic they like or one that was seen that day and present it to the team in a 2-minute talk the following day
- Not done every day… can be too much if the next day is a call day
- Keeps medical students entertained and typically you learn something
- Ex. “Hey Austin, can you research Cellulitis tonight and teach it to me tomorrow? Only looking for like a 2-minute brief talk”

## Chalk Talks

- Short, 2-to-5-minute presentations
- Keep it narrow and SHORT. Digestible.
- Goal is to teach while learning the topic yourself in a simplified manner without missing the key points
- Pick a Relevant Topic (take inspiration from your patients)
- Things you only briefly touched on during rounds
- Teach them your thought process
- Debunking common myths helps (stay evidence based)
- Use figures/flow charts
- Stay FOCUSED
- Suggestions:
    - Cerebral Edema
    - Anemia
    - AKI
    - AECOPD
    - Chest Pain
    - DKA
    - GDMT
    - Meningitis
    - Uncontrolled Hypertension
