## Expectations/Responsibilities

- As seniors, the incoming interns look to you for guidance
    - Be the senior you had/wanted when you first started

- Communicate with your team
    - You’re the captain of your team, but you can’t steer the ship alone

- Talk up, not down
    - We’ve all been the July intern, no one needs to be put down or singled out

- Address concerns early
    - If you’re worried about something, bring it up
    - This gives everyone time to fix problems before they become habits
    - If you don’t know how to fix a problem, ASK
    - This is what the chiefs/attendings are here for

- You don’t have to be perfect
    - We all mess stuff up, but you should stick up for your interns
    - Don’t throw interns under the bus…. This is a TEAM
    - “I’m sorry, I’m not sure what happened, but we will fix it”

- PATIENCE
    - Not an easy thing, this takes time
    - Small sacrifices early will make the interns more independent later on
    - Over the next year, you’ll see the PGY-1’s progress and you’ll be amazed

## Running the Team

- Ensure patients are distributed appropriately each day, including who will see new admissions, and a reasonable distribution of the work
- Supervise and run team rounds with attending support
- “Task Master”, keep the team moving, keep notes on important tasks
- Run list and ensure orders, consults, and discharges are complete
- Ensure interns are completing all assigned duties and aid with direct care duties (i.e., calling consults, arranging discharges, updating list)
- Perform sign out on long call days
- Assist with teaching the medical student(s) and/or making time in the day for teaching (More on this later)
- Ensure all notes and tasks are complete, prepare list for handoff
