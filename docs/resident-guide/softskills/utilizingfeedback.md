## Elicit Feedback

- Communicate your needs and goals; prepare others to expect elicitation of feedback
- Ask for feedback; accept it graciously
- Perceive feedback as a potential learning tool, not a criticism or attack
- Manifest receptive body language
- Be aware of the feelings elicited in you by the feedback, and manage them appropriately
- Avoid defensive responses, even if feedback is perceived as inappropriate
- Ask for clarification or a specific example
- Ask for specific ideas about how the issue can be resolved, problem solve
- Use active listening skill: rephrase, paraphrase
- Thank the provider whenever appropriate

## Tips for Eliciting Feedback

- Present your perceptions, avoid excuses
- Focus on issue presented
- Try and keep own ego separate from behavior
- Keep in mind that all feedback is a reflection of the sender’s mood, perceptions, and personality
- Remember that making mistakes is human and that generally the worst mistake is not to learn from one’s mistakes
- Reflect on feedback after the interaction; validate it by eliciting feedback or data from other sources when appropriate
