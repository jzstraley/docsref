## Tips for Eliciting Feedback

- Share your perspective without making excuses.
- Stay focused on the specific issue being discussed.
- Separate identity from behavior. Feedback addresses actions, not character.
- Recognize that feedback reflects the giver’s perceptions and context.
- Accept that mistakes are inevitable. The greater error is failing to learn from them.
- After the interaction, reflect thoughtfully. When appropriate, validate themes by seeking additional perspectives or objective data.
